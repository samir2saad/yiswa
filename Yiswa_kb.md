### App Concept & Purchase Methods

**Q1: What is the Idea of the app?**
A: The app is based on a reverse auction model. Each auction starts at the market price and gradually decreases. You can purchase a product either through the "Buy Now" option if the price suits you, or by selecting "Set Price Target", where you set your desired price. Once the auction price reaches your selected amount, the saved card in your profile will be charged and the auction will be awarded to you. Note: The auction ends once the product is sold out.

**Q2: How can I make a purchase on the app?**
A: There are three ways to purchase:
- Option 1: "Buy Now" – Purchase the product immediately when it reaches your preferred price. Select the quantity, delivery address, and payment method (KNET, credit card, or Apple Pay).
- Option 2: "Set Price Target" – Set the price you're willing to pay, then select the quantity and confirm. If the auction reaches your set price, the product will be awarded to you automatically. (Your credit card details must be saved in advance.)
- Option 3: "Price Match" – Choose a product and enter the price you want. You get three attempts. If your price is accepted, you win and delivery is within 24 hours. If you use all three attempts, the product becomes locked for you but resets at the start of each month.

**Q25: Why does Yiswa offer prices lower than the market price? What's the point of the app?**
A: Yiswa is an online marketplace, so we can keep prices competitive by reducing the overhead costs of physical stores (such as rent and showroom expenses). That's why we're often able to offer lower-than-market prices through our deals and app features.

**Q28: The auction was live and it's over, and I didn't buy anything. Can I get it again?**
A: If you didn't purchase the item during the live auction, you'll need to wait until the deal is uploaded again. If you previously used Set Price Target and the auction didn't reach your price, you'll be automatically notified when the product goes live again.

**Q27: How can I find a certain product?**
A: Use the search icon at the top-right of the page you're browsing.
Note: Search works within the current page only (not across the entire app).
