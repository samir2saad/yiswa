## CHUNK 2: App Overview & How to Purchase

**Topic:** Understanding the App Concept and Purchase Methods

**Key Information:**
- The app uses a reverse auction model where prices start high and gradually decrease
- Two purchasing methods available: "Buy Now" and "Set Price Target"
- Auctions end when products are sold out

**Questions & Answers:**

**Q1: What is the Idea of the app?**
A: The app is based on a reverse auction model. Each auction starts at the market price and gradually decreases. You can purchase a product either through the "Buy Now" option if the price suits you, or by selecting "Set Price Target", where you set your desired price. Once the auction price reaches your selected amount, the saved card in your profile will be charged and the auction will be awarded to you. Note: The auction ends once the product is sold out.

**Q2: How can I make a purchase on the app?**
A: There are two ways to purchase:
- Option 1: "Buy Now" – Purchase the product immediately when it reaches your preferred price. Select the quantity, delivery address, and payment method (credit card or Apple Pay).
- Option 2: "Set Price Target" – Set the price you're willing to pay, then select the quantity and confirm. If the auction reaches your set price, the product will be awarded to you automatically. (Your credit card details must be saved in advance.)
